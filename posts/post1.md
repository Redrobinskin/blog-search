The file "posts/post1.md" is a markdown file and does not contain any executable code. It would contain the formatted text of the first rewritten post. Here is an example of what it might look like:

```
# Post Title

Post content...

## Summary

Summary content...

## Key Words

- Key word 1
- Key word 2
- Key word 3
- Key word 4
- Key word 5

## Further Research

- Source 1
- Source 2
- Source 3
```

Please note that the actual content of the file would be dynamically generated by the program and would depend on the specific post that is being rewritten.
